# CO3061-AI-Puzzle-Pipes
My application solves Puzzle-pipe game acording to https://www.puzzle-pipes.com/
In this project, I use both blind search and heuristics search to find series of action that can solve this game.
Two algorithms I use:
- Blind search: Breath-First Search
- Heuristics search: A* algorithm\n

To run this application, just run main.py
